Our aim was to develop a solution for drought conditions through effective water diversion from dams. To achieve this, We first analyzed historical water level and water storage data to determine the water storage at minimum water level. Then, We established a comprehensive model of the dams and river systems to simulate real-world scenarios. This model was designed to manage water diversion, addressing the needs of five states reliant on water from two major lakes. The key output of this project is a robust drought mitigation model that carefully balances factors such as state GDP, industry water usage, and historical stability of water usage.
