Our aim was to forecast the player count for the Wordle game. To achieve this, We selected and improved an ARIMA model using Markov Chain techniques. Then, We fitted a Gaussian Regression model to analyze the distribution of user attempt frequencies for specific words. Additionally, We categorized words based on their difficulties using K-means clustering and validated the clustering results with AdaBoost. The key contribution of this project is the development of a predictive model that not only estimates player numbers but also provides insights into player interactions and word difficulty levels.
