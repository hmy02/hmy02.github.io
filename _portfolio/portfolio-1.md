Computer calibration is of great relevance in various fields such as industry and commerce. Our work aims to create a new computer calibration algorithm GOLS to improve the accuracy. We give proofs from a theoretical aspect and compare it with two other computer calibration methods (KO and OLS) in real physical experiments.
