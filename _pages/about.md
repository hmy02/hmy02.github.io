I'm a senior undergraduate student from [Faculty of science](https://slxy.bjut.edu.cn/), [Beijing University of Technology](https://www.bjut.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computational neuroscience, machine learning, deep learning and their applications in clinical medicine or sociology. Beyond that, my ultimate life goal is probably to transcend the constraints of existing neural networks and build a brain-like learning model from scratch, even though this might currently be limited by our shallow understanding of the brain.

Besides, I'm very interested in the application of AI in games, and I'd like to make a game where players can build a social legal system from scratch through AI, where players can input their laws in their own words without only being stuck with the options.I'm sure this would be a game with a lot of freedom.
